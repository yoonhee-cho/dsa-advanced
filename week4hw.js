Challenge 1: Given the following graphs, 
appropriately label them as being 
undirected-weighted, 
directed-weighted, 
undirected-unweighted, 
and directed-unweighted.  
 
Graph 1:  
Graph 2: 
Graph 3: 
Graph 4:

/*
Challenge 2: Define what vertices and edges mean to you.

/*
Challenge 3: You were just hired as a backend engineer for a new start-up to compete with LinkedIn, and your 
first task as a engineer was to create a undirected, unweighted graph of the first 4 users of the website. Create a 
Graph class that utilizes a adjacencyList to structure the graph of the mutual connections between each user.  
 
Create the following methods:  
- addVertex(v): v – vertex to add 
- addEdge(v1, v2): v1 – first vertex to add, v2 – second vertex to add 
- removeEdge(v1, v2): v1 – first vertex to remove, v2 – second vertex to remove 
- removeVertex(v): v – vertex to remove 
 
Step 1: Seed some data - here is the list of friends and their initial mutual connections:
